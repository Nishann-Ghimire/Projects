We have a text file for storing the words we are using in the game .
We read the file and grab words sequentially using loop

Inside loop ::
    We count the letter present in the words and store same no of blank spaces in the array which we are storing 
    the half filled words which is to be presented to the user. let's called that array as userArr[] 

    now we present userArr[] to user and ask for user input for letter 
    we check whether the letter given by user matches with any of the letter in our original word.

    and if condition is true we insert the letter in the userArr[] at proper position and if 
    the confition is false we decrease the player life by one which is 6 by default.

when life reaches 0 we  ask whether usr wants to continue or not if yes we repeat same process else we quit.
